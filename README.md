# Project Overview
\
This analysis examines 15 schools' and 39,170 students' reading and math performance. It considers the schools' type, size and budget as well as the students' grade levels and genders. 
# Executive Summary
\
The evaluation ranked students' overall performance by the top 5 schools. Initially, Cabrera High School (1) and Thomas High School (2) demonstrated the top marks for both reading and math. However, evidence of academic dishonesty came to light for Thomas High School's ninth graders. As a result, a second analysis removed this problematic data, and replaced the reading and math scores with "not a number value" (NaN). Griffin High School assumed the second-place-ranking afterward.
