# Project Overview
\
This analysis examines 15 schools' and 39,170 students' reading and math performance. It considers the schools' type, size and budget as well as the students' grade levels and genders. 
# Executive Summary
\
The evaluation ranked students' overall performance by the top 5 schools. Initially, Cabrera High School (1) and Thomas High School (2) demonstrated the top marks for both reading and math. However, evidence of academic dishonesty came to light for Thomas High School's ninth graders. As a result, a second analysis removed this problematic data, and replaced the reading and math scores with "not a number value" (NaN). Griffin High School assumed the second-place-ranking afterward.
# Results

**Overall Performance**
\
The top five high schools for overall performance were:

\
Griffin High School moved into second place after the scores of Thomas High School's ninth graders were removed from the analysis. Wright High School shifted into the fifth ranking. Thomas High School's upper classman did not perform as well as Wright High School's upper classman. For example, Wright High School's 11th graders earned 83.84% in math. Its 12th graders obtained a 84.07% in reading. Comparatively, Thomas High School's 11th graders received math scores of 83.50%. It's 12th graders posted reading scores of 83.83%. While the score-differences beween the high schools appeared marginal, it effectively pushed Thomas High School out of the top-five-schools-list.
\
The district's overall performance look similar before and after Thomas High School's data alterations.

\
Overall performance dropped about 1% to 64% passing.
